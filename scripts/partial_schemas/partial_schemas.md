# Partial Schemas

These subdirectories each contain the necessary code to create an edgedb instance with a partial
IFC schema. 

The examples shows how parts of the IFC schema can either be explicitly defined manually or extracted from an IFC file.
The EdgeModel class will find all related IFC classes to ensure that the partial schema is complete with 
all related classes.

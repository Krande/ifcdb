# Basic Schema

A stripped down IFC schema that is small enough so that it exceed current schema size limits in EdgeDB and also so
that the migration step does not take too long. 

With that being said, the schema should contain a sufficient number of IFC entities so that it is possible to
use it as a prototype demo with the ability to model most geometries.
